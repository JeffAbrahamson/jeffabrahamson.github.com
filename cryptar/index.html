<h1>Cryptar</h1>

<h2>What is Cryptar?</h2>

<p>
Cryptar is a  free network-efficient encrypted backup and restore
application.
(Geek version:  It
is akin to using rsync to maintain a mirror of your data, except
that everything is encrypted:  plaintext never leaves your local host.)

<p>
Cryptar is also a library that permits application developers to store
their data in the cloud (using AWS, on a remote filesystem via ssh,
etc.) easily and with full encryption.  In addition, the cryptar API
permits easy and simple data sharing with other users of the same
application without revealing non-shared data.
The cryptar API permits data to be stored naturally using a filesystem
metaphor or as simple key-value pairs (Berkeley DB model).

<p>
Cryptar is coming soon.  If you are looking for the source code, look
<a href="https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/cryptar">here</a>.


<h2>Why Cryptar?</h2>

<p>
Most applications that store data in the cloud either spin their own
encryption or else risk revealing personal data.  While some
applications have underlying business models that require the
application provider to read the data, many do not, and customers are
increasingly concerned about data privacy.

<p>
Cryptar ensures that plaintext never leaves the local host.


<h2>How does it all Work?</h2>

<p>
Cryptar implements the cryptar algorithm, as
described in the paper <a
href="https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/cryptar/blob/master/paper/abrahamson2004cryptar-improved.pdf">Cryptar:
Secure, Untrustful, Differencing Backup</a> (J. Abrahamson,
A. J. O'Donnell, <i>Cryptar: Secure, Untrustful, Differencing Backup</i>,
NordU/usenix conference, Copenhagen, Denmark, 31 January - 1 February
2004.).
The cryptar algorithm is a variation on the rsync algorithm, in which
remote checksums are stored separately in order to permit rsync's
efficient differencing algorithm without unencrypted data ever leaving
the local host.



<h2>Free?</h2>

Cryptar is available under two licenses.
<ul>
  <li> You may use cryptar under the terms of the GPL.  It is free to
      you and to your users, but you do have to make available your
      own source code under the same terms.
  <li> You may use cryptar under a proprietary license and so avoid
      the constraints of the GPL.
</ul>
